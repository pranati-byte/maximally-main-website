        🎯 The Real Test Begins After the Exam Ends
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        You've spent years solving algebra problems, memorizing history dates, and writing essays about Shakespeare. But the truth hits hard when you step outside the classroom: No one ever taught you how to manage money, speak confidently, or turn your idea into a business.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        Let's be honest—school often skips the most important lessons.

        <p className="mb-4">Real-world skills are the practical, everyday abilities you'll use in your personal and professional life. Unlike textbook knowledge, these are the things that help you thrive in the real world—from building relationships to making your first income.</p>
        <p>Learning these early gives you a massive head start.</p>

            <strong>Example:</strong> Aarav (17) learned about budgeting during a startup bootcamp. He now tracks every rupee and invests small amounts in mutual funds.
