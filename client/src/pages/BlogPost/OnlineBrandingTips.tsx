        Ever feel like your awesome achievements, cool projects, or even just your hilarious memes disappear into the vastness of the internet? You're not alone! In today's digital world, getting noticed online can feel like shouting into a hurricane.

      <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">What Exactly is Student Branding?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Think of big companies like Nike or Apple. They have a distinct brand – a feeling, a set of values, and a visual identity that makes them instantly recognizable. Student branding is similar, but it's about you. It's the unique story you tell online through your social media profiles, personal website, and any other digital footprint you create.

      <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">Building Your Authentic Online Presence</h2>
      
      <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">1. Define Your Niche and Passion</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">What are you truly passionate about? What are your unique skills and interests? Maybe you're a coding whiz, a talented artist, a passionate debater, or a budding environmental activist. Identifying your niche will help you focus your online content and attract the right kind of attention.</p>

      <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">2. Choose Your Platforms Wisely</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">You don't need to be everywhere online. Instead, focus on the platforms where your target audience is likely to be:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>For showcasing creative work: Instagram, Behance, DeviantArt, YouTube</li>
        <li>For sharing academic achievements: LinkedIn (yes, even for students!)</li>
        <li>For engaging in discussions: Twitter</li>
        <li>For connecting with friends: Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">3. Craft Compelling Content</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Create content that showcases your personality, skills, and passions. Show, don't just tell – share your work, projects, and insights regularly.</p>

      <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">4. Optimize Your Online Profiles</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Make it easy for people to find you and understand what you're all about:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Use a consistent username and profile picture</li>
        <li>Write a clear and concise bio</li>
        <li>Link your profiles together</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">5. Network and Engage</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Building relationships is key to getting noticed online. Connect with people in your field, engage authentically, and seek out mentors.</p>

      <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">6. Be Mindful of Your Digital Footprint</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Remember that everything you post contributes to your brand. Use privacy settings wisely and think before you post!</p>
