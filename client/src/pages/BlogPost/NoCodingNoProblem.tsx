        "I can't even code Hello World, how can I build a startup?" This question echoes through the minds of countless Indian teenagers who have brilliant ideas but lack programming experience. At Maximally's 7-day virtual makeathon, this concern becomes irrelevant. Over 60% of successful participants arrive with zero coding experience, yet leave with fully functional MVPs and newfound confidence in their ability to build technology solutions.

        <strong>The future of entrepreneurship isn't about who can write the most complex code - it's about who can solve real problems using the powerful tools available today.</strong>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">The Advantage of Fresh Perspectives</h3>
      <p>
        Non-technical participants often bring unique advantages to startup development:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>User-Centric Thinking:</strong> Without getting lost in technical complexities, beginners focus on solving actual user problems rather than showcasing programming skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Problem-Solving:</strong> Limited by technical constraints, non-coders find innovative solutions using available tools and platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Focus:</strong> While technical participants might over-engineer solutions, beginners concentrate on market validation and user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication Skills:</strong> Non-technical founders often excel at explaining complex ideas simply, crucial for pitching and user acquisition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">Real Success Stories from Non-Coders</h3>
